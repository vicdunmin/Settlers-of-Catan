### Basic Introduction:

The game is modelled on the classic ["Settlers of Catan"](https://www.catan.com/game/catan) board game in python. This includes all the rules in the official rulebook. The inclusion of socket allows multiplayers to operate on the same game board at the same time and interact with each other by trading "goods".
